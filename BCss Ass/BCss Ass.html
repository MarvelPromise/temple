             <p>Music, cooking, baking, singing, dancing, exploring, science and tech; a little list of my likes.

                I mean music is an essential part of life, feeding the soul part of our being, which include singing and dancing.
            Kitchen/culinary Mastery is a big dream for me, wishing to be a kitchen/culinary master. And not all can stay without being curious, curious cats like me, can't help but explore to feed our curiousity.
            Speak life in the 21st century, speak science and techs. Life in the 21st century is full of science and techs, and as product of this century, can't help but be science and tech concious, curious, minded and so on.
